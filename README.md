### Customize The Text
The text has a canvas area, which makes it easy to change it to single or multiple lines while having control over the alignment. Of course, you can use any typeface you’d like and it’ll automatically synchronize to all the screens.

### Preview
The results are previewed directly in the document, making it easy to see if you did something wrong. Plus, it is encouraged to edit the final screens to give more individuality.
